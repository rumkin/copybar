# CopyBar

CopyBar is a component which helps developers to provide information about others' code they use in web applications they create. This should help authors of libraries to advertise own work and receive some value from it.

## Proposal

Convert copyright message like "©, Author, 2019" into group of links or buttons, where:

* "©" refers to about section with package dependencies
* "Authour" refers to author's contact information
* "2019" refers to app's changelog.
